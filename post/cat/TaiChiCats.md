## 《Chapter 1》

I have just returned from a visit to my landlord--the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. 

This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. 
 
 A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. 
 
 A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still farther in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.
